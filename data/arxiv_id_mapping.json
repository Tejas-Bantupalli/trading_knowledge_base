[{"id": "0801.0003", "abstract": ": We introduce a stochastic heterogeneous interacting-agent mod el for the short-time non-equilibrium evolution of excess demand and price in a stylized asse t market. We consider a combination of social interaction within peer groups and individually he terogeneous fundamentalist trading decisions which take into account the market price and the p erceived fundamental value of the asset. The resulting excess demand is coupled to the market pr ice. Rigorous analysis reveals that this feedback may lead to price oscillations, a single bounce, or m onotonic price behaviour. The model is a rare example of an analytically tractable interacting-a gent model which allows us to deduce in detail the origin of these di\ufb00erent collective patterns. For a natural choice of initial distribution the results are independent of the graph structure t hat models the peer network of agents whose decisions in\ufb02uence each other."}, {"id": "0801.0631", "abstract": ". Far-from-equilibrium models of interacting particles in o ne dimension are used as a basis for modelling the stock-market \ufb02uctuations. Particle types an d their positions are interpreted as buy and sel orders placed on a price axis in the order book. We revisit some modi\ufb01cations of well-known models, starting withthe Bak-Paczuski-Shubikmodel. Welook at the four decades old Stigler model and investigate its variants. One of them is the simpli\ufb01ed version of the Geno a arti\ufb01cial market. The list of studied models is completed by the models of Maslov and Daniels et al. Generi cally, in all cases we compare the return distribution, absolute return autocorrelation and the val ue of the Hurst exponent. It turns out that none of the models reproduces satisfactorily all the empirical dat a, but the most promising candidates for further development are the Genoa arti\ufb01cial market and the Maslov mo del with moderate order evaporation."}, {"id": "0801.0718", "abstract": ". In [4] the notion of stickiness for stochastic processes was intr oduced. It was also shown that stickiness implies absence of arbitrage in a market with pro portional transaction costs. In this paper, we investigate the notion of stickiness further. In particu lar, we give examples of processes that are not semimartingales but are sticky."}, {"id": "0801.0969", "abstract": "A deterministic system of interacting agents is considered as a model for economic dynamics. The dynamics of the system is described by a couple d map lattice with near neighbor interactions. Theevolution of each agent res ults from thecompetition between two factors: the agent\u2019s own tendency to grow and the environmental in\ufb02u- ence that moderates this growth. Depending on the values of t he parameters that control these factors, the system can display Pareto or Bolt zmann-Gibbs statistical behaviors in its asymptotic dynamical regime. The regions w here these behaviors appear are calculated on the space of parameters of the syste m.
